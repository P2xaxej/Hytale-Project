HYTALE: LIVING WORLD & COMBAT REVOLUTION
============================================================

[CONCEPT OVERVIEW]
These ideas aim to revolutionize the cubic sandbox genre by 
introducing ecological consequences, tactical combat, and 
[cite_start]meaningful faction diplomacy

[cite: 1]. 

MARKING SYSTEM:
+ Idea Accepted: The concept fits the project vision. [cite: 2]
- Idea Not Accepted: The concept requires rework or removal. [cite: 2]

------------------------------------------------------------
I. WORLD & ECOSYSTEM
------------------------------------------------------------
* "Time Asset" & Gaia's Cleansing(This part relates to the databases from the time asset#number#fraction tag.)
I can even suggest how to implement it. The base from the camp to the citadel that is generated in the world will have the tag "time asset#number#fraction" And each NPC on the base is given the tag "time asset #number#fraction" When all NPCs with this tag die, the base with the same tag begins to count down by which it begins to break: Cleared bases trigger a 
  4–10 day timer where Nature (Gaia) reclaims the land. [cite_start][+] [cite: 3]
  Roots and moss consume structures to reduce server load. [cite_start][-] [cite: 4]
The same. I forgot to add that Gaia only destroys buildings that are factional. Example: after destroying the alien base, after a while, the gaia begins to destroy the base, taking its own. 
I can even suggest how to implement it. The base from the camp to the citadel that is generated in the world will have the tag "time asset#number#fraction" And each NPC on the base is given the tag "time asset #number#fraction" When all NPCs with this tag die, the base with the same tag begins to count down by which it begins to break

* Point of No Return (50%): If 50%+ of a base is reclaimed, 
  enemies cannot return. [cite_start][+] [cite: 4]
  Below 50%, they can attempt to retake and restore it. [cite_start][-] [cite: 5]

* Two-Level Repair & Workshop: Field repairs lower max 
  durability (e.g., 100 to 90 and so on). [cite_start][+] [cite: 6]
  Full 100% restoration requires a Workshop and resources. [cite_start][-] [cite: 7]

* Stress & Demographics: Peaceful races (Kweebecs/Ferans) 
  react to danger. [cite_start][+] [cite: 2, 8]
  High stress stops reproduction and triggers "Military Mode". [cite_start][-] [cite: 9]

* Village Evolution: Settlements grow from Small to Large. [cite_start][+] [cite: 10]
  Paths: "Peaceful" (trade) or "Military" (defense). [cite_start][-] [cite: 11]

------------------------------------------------------------
II. FACTION DYNAMICS & DIPLOMACY
------------------------------------------------------------
* Kill Tactics: Trorks target warriors (honor). [cite_start][+] [cite: 12]
  The Void kills "the future" (children/elderly). [cite_start][-] [cite: 13]
  Scaraks attack indiscriminately due to hunger. [cite_start][+] [cite: 14]

* Diplomacy: Neutral start with Humans and Outlanders. [cite_start][+] [cite: 14]
  Helping one damages reputation with the other. [cite_start][-] [cite: 15]

* Strategic Messengers: Messengers ask for help. [cite_start][+] [cite: 16]
  Choice: Defend village vs. Strike enemy base. [cite_start][-] [cite: 17]

------------------------------------------------------------
III. COMBAT & MAGIC SYSTEMS
------------------------------------------------------------
* Core Movement: Dodge roll (Q) avoids heavy attacks. [cite_start][+] [cite: 18]
  "Perfect Block" stuns enemies (15s PvP cooldown). [cite_start][-] [cite: 19]

* [cite_start]Weapon Specialization: [+] [cite: 2, 20]
  - Piercing: Breaks blocks; high penalty if countered. [cite_start][-] [cite: 20]
  - Mobility: Speed increases damage; lower stamina costs. [cite_start][+] [cite: 21]
  - From Block: Massive counter-power; strict timing. [cite_start][-] [cite: 22]
  - Crowd: Wide swings for group damage distribution. [cite_start][+] [cite:  23]
  - Strength: Slow, heavy swings with colossal damage. [cite_start][-] [cite: 23]

* [cite_start]Elemental Magic: [+] [cite: 2, 24]
  - Electricity: Water conductivity; stuns enemies. [cite_start][-] [cite: 24]
  - Air (Freedom): Terrain control and knockbacks. [cite_start][+] [cite: 25]
  - Fire: Pure high damage. [cite_start][-] [cite: 25]
  - Earth: Stuns and immobilization. [cite_start][+] [cite: 26]
  - Water: Foundation for elemental combos. [cite_start][-] [cite: 26]
  - Void: Necromancy and poisoning. [cite_start][+] [cite: 27]

------------------------------------------------------------
IV. PROGRESSION & KNOWLEDGE
------------------------------------------------------------
* Skill Trees: Leveling Crafting, Combat, and Movement. [cite_start][+] [cite: 27]
* Artifacts: Items that buff the chosen playstyle. [cite_start][-] [cite: 28]
* Endings: Finale depends on Gaia (Nature) vs. Varyn (Order). [cite_start][+] [cite: 28]
* In-game Wiki: Knowledge base unlocked via exploration. [cite_start][-] [cite:  29]
