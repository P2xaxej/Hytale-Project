------------------------------------------------------------
I. WORLD & ECOSYSTEM
------------------------------------------------------------
* "Time Asset" & Gaia's Cleansing: Cleared bases trigger a 
  4–10 day timer where Nature (Gaia) reclaims the land. [+]
  Roots and moss consume structures to reduce server load. [-]

* Point of No Return (50%): If 50%+ of a base is reclaimed, 
  enemies cannot return. [+]
  Below 50%, they can attempt to retake and restore it. [-]

* Two-Level Repair & Workshop: Field repairs lower max 
  durability (e.g., 100 to 90). [+]
  Full 100% restoration requires a Workshop and resources. [-]

* Stress & Demographics: Peaceful races (Kweebecs/Ferans) 
  react to danger. [+]
  High stress stops reproduction and triggers "Military Mode". [-]

* Village Evolution: Settlements grow from Small to Large. [+]
  Paths: "Peaceful" (trade) or "Military" (defense). [-]

------------------------------------------------------------
II. FACTION DYNAMICS & DIPLOMACY
------------------------------------------------------------
* Kill Tactics: Trorks target warriors (honor). [+]
  The Void kills "the future" (children/elderly). [-]
  Scaraks attack indiscriminately due to hunger. [+]

* Diplomacy: Neutral start with Humans and Outlanders. [+]
  Helping one damages reputation with the other. [-]

* Strategic Messengers: Messengers ask for help. [+]
  Choice: Defend village vs. Strike enemy base. [-]

------------------------------------------------------------
III. COMBAT & MAGIC SYSTEMS
------------------------------------------------------------
* Core Movement: Dodge roll (Q) avoids heavy attacks. [+]
