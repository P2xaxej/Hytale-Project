HYTALE: LIVING WORLD & COMBAT


[CONCEPT OVERVIEW]
These ideas aim to revolutionize the cubic sandbox genre by 
introducing ecological consequences, tactical combat, and 
meaningful faction diplomacy

------------------------------------------------------------
I. WORLD & ECOSYSTEM
------------------------------------------------------------
* "Time Asset" & Gaia's Cleansing(This part relates to the databases from the time asset#number#fraction tag.)
  4–10 day timer where Nature (Gaia) reclaims the land. 
  Roots and moss consume structures to reduce server load. 
The same. I forgot to add that Gaia only destroys buildings that are factional.
Example: after destroying the alien base, after a while, the gaia begins to destroy the base, taking its own. 
I can even suggest how to implement it. The base from the camp to the citadel that is generated in the world will have the tag
"time_asset#number#fraction"
And each NPC on the base is given the tag
"time_asset#number#fraction"
When all NPCs with this tag die, the base with the same tag begins to count down by which it begins to break

* Point of No Return (50%): If 50%+ of a base is reclaimed, 
  enemies cannot return.
  Below 50%, they can attempt to retake and restore it.

* Two-Level Repair & Workshop: Field repairs lower max 
  durability (e.g., 100 to 90 and so on). 
  Full 100% restoration requires a Workshop and resources. 

* Stress & Demographics: Peaceful races (Kweebecs/Ferans) 
  react to danger.
  High stress stops reproduction and triggers "Military Mode". 

* Village Evolution: Settlements grow from Small to Large. 
  Paths: "Peaceful" (trade) or "Military" (defense). 

------------------------------------------------------------
II. FACTION DYNAMICS & DIPLOMACY
------------------------------------------------------------
* Kill Tactics: Trorks target warriors (honor). 
  The Void kills "the future" (children/elderly).
  Scaraks attack indiscriminately due to hunger.

* Diplomacy: Neutral start with Humans and Outlanders. 
  Helping one damages reputation with the other.

* Strategic Messengers: Messengers ask for help.
  Choice: Defend village vs. Strike enemy base.

------------------------------------------------------------
III. COMBAT & MAGIC SYSTEMS
------------------------------------------------------------
* Core Movement: Dodge roll (Q) avoids heavy attacks.
  "Perfect Block" stuns enemies (15s PvP cooldown).

*   Weapon Specialization:
  - Piercing: Breaks blocks; high penalty if countered. 
  - Mobility: Speed increases damage; lower stamina costs. 
  - From Block: Massive counter-power; strict timing. 
  - Crowd: Wide swings for group damage distribution. 
  - Strength: Slow, heavy swings with colossal damage. 
  Each stance has its own pose and charged attack.
  This mechanic can be improved through the Skill Tree (Paragraph IV).
  And you can also make it so that at the end of a separate branch of the stand there will be her special ult
  Artifacts can also have buffs for a particular stance or element of magic. as well as for passive skills (Roll, Block, Speed, Regeneration, Mana)
 
  Ranged weapons currently have a very limited choice between a crossbow and a bow.
  I think it would be great to add powerful gunpowder weapons since the game already has a musket. I think the arquebus
  Pishchal
  Carbine
  Rifle
  and the musket itself
  with upgrades would be suitable for gunpowder. It's important that the damage be strong but not one-shot.
   This will synergize with the skill tree, specifically the reload speed.
   And the most interesting thing is the ground cannon, which deals lethal damage,
   but it must be assembled from three parts each time the player wants to deploy it, and each part takes 5 seconds to deploy (15 seconds total).
   A shot requires 20 gunpowder and a cannonball (regular or high-explosive).

*   Elemental Magic:
  - Electricity: Water conductivity; stuns enemies.
  - Air (Freedom): Terrain control and knockbacks. 
  - Fire: Pure high damage.
  - Earth: Stuns and immobilization.
  - Water: Foundation for elemental combos.
  - Void: Necromancy and poisoning.

------------------------------------------------------------
IV. PROGRESSION & KNOWLEDGE
------------------------------------------------------------
* Skill Trees: Leveling Crafting, Combat, and Movement.
* Artifacts: Items that buff the chosen playstyle.
* Endings: Finale depends on Gaia vs Varyn .
* In-game Wiki: Knowledge base unlocked via exploration.

------------------------------------------------------------
V. COLLECTIVENESS OF FACTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
It's important to ensure that factions work together and raise the alarm.
Raising the alarm - upon seeing a player or enemy at the base, a faction NPC will raise the alarm.
Teamwork - when fighting a player or enemy, factions will work together as a team rather than scattered.
During combat, melee soldiers will protect against attempts to kill ranged soldiers or mages.
NPC allies will cover them when their HP drops below 35%.
This will give NPCs more vigorous defense of their base or during an attack on another's base.

------------------------------------------------------------
VI. NPC INTERACTIONS AND REGULAR LIFE
------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, the life of any NPC consists of sleeping, walking, and standing still.
I think players would appreciate more variety in NPC life.
It's possible to temporarily change NPC life after an attack on their base.
During normal times, NPCs typically perform their routine.
They eat, cook, talk, stand guard, sit, play (this part mostly applies to children),
and perform actions related to specific Factions.
After an attack or battle, NPCs can treat wounds,
bury the dead, or hold meetings (this could be added to normal times).
NPC relationships could be enhanced with friendship (certain NPCs are more likely to be around each other or talk to each other)
or gifts.

------------------------------------------------------------
VII. Cooking and Variety
------------------------------------------------------------
Cooking is currently very underdeveloped in Hytale.
I propose introducing a mechanic where cooking goes beyond simply creating food,
but rather adds food items that provide specific buffs.
This would allow players to craft food to suit their playstyle.
